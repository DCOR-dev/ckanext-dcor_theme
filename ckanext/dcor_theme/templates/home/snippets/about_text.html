<p>The Deformability Cytometry Open Repository (DCOR) is a data
repository designed for managing and working with deformability cytometry (DC)
(.rtdc) files.</p>

<p>DCOR fully integrates with the existing DC software stack which is built
on <a href="https://dclab.readthedocs.io/">dclab</a>. Public and private
data on DCOR are transparently accessible in dclab, just as if they were
files on disk. This makes it possible to run analysis pipelines (e.g. high performance
computing) and manual data analysis (e.g.
<a href="https://github.com/ZELLMECHANIK-DRESDEN/ShapeOut2">Shape-Out</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/Rivercyte/CytoPlot/releases/">CytoPlot</a>)
with all data stored in a central, safe, and accessible place.</p>

<p>DCOR is based on <a href="CKAN">https://ckan.org/</a> with the addition of
a permission system that enforces reproducible research and several other
extensions that streamline DC data management and analysis. DCOR is fully
open source (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">AGPL-3.0</a>)
and developed at <a href="https://github.com/DCOR-dev/">https://github.com/DCOR-dev/</a>.</p>
